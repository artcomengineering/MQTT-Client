## About the App - Description
The app has a control range, with the ability to control between zero and five lights and doors, depending on the use case. By means of a red-green indicator, the user is shown the connection status of the server.

Depending on the use case, the controls for the lights or doors can be switched on and off. For the individual lights and doors, the corresponding theme as well as the message can be set. In addition, further settings for the transmission can be selected.
